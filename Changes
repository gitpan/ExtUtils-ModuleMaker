Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.

0.33 July 8, 2005
	- Primary maintenance taken over by James E Keenan
	  (jkeenan@cpan.org).
        - scripts/modulemaker
	  - modulemaker utility revised with objective of making it
	    possible to specify all options on the command-line
          - Included ABSTRACT in Main Menu and created prompt for new abstract
          - Allowed for additional command-line options for specification 
            of abstract and author info
          - Modified Usage message to reflect additional command-line 
            options; placed options in alphabetical order
        - lib/ExtUtils/ModuleMaker.pm:
          - Corrected typing errors in several places
          - Modified ORGANIZATION in POD to parallel wording of CPANID
          - Changed $defaults{ABSTRACT} to 'Module abstract 
            (<= 44 characters) goes here'
          - Allowed for ORGANIZATION, where defined, to be included in 
            AUTHOR COMPOSITE and thereby included in Author section of POD
	  - Fixed Block_Begin() and Block_Begin_BareBones() to eliminate 
            blank first line in .pm files
	  - Deletion of superseded/deprecated subroutines and
            corresponding POD
        - t/*.t
	  - Corrected names of test files on first lines of each of 
            02_simple.t, 03_quick.t and 04_compact.t
          - Created 05_abstract. to test current and new features:
              -- correct Author and Email in Makefile.PL
              -- placement of Abstract in POD
              -- placement of Author info in POD
              -- placement of History info in POD rather than in Changes
          - Created t/06_build.t and t/07_proxy.t to test alternative
            BUILD_SYSTEMs
	  - Created t/08_modulemaker.t to pave the way for testing of
	    the modulemaker utility (much to be done)

--------------------------------------------------------------

0.32 June 16 2003 (YAPC::Boca_Raton)
	- Removed Fakefile.PL that was for testing but only caused
	  problems.  The content has been held over after __END__
	  in Makefile.PL
	- Added missing fullname for libpng license which was causing
	  an odd number of parts in a hash
	- Added support for Module::Build (patch from Dave Rolsky)
	- Fixed misplaced backslash when generating the new method
	- Generated Makefile.PL now has a prerequisite of Test::Simple


--------------------------------------------------------------

	- Licenses in two new modules:

		ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Licenses::Local
	- Customize for local environment by subclassing, example in

	- New interactive script 'modulemaker'
	- Removed old scripts 'newmodule' and 'eumm'
	- Old functions are deprecated, but still here for now
		Quick_Module
		Generate_Module_Files
