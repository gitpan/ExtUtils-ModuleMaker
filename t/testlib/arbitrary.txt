=pod

This is an illustration of arbitrary text to be inserted into each of the
lib/*.pm files created by a particular run of ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.

By default, this code is placed after any constructor and before the main POD
block.  If you want to put it elsewhere, you should subclass
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::StandardText::compose_pm_file().

You may include both POD and code, as illustrated here.

To include this code in the lib/*.pm files in your distribution, pass a 
key-value pair like the following to ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::new():

    INCLUDE_FILE_IN_PM => qq{/path/to/some/arbitrary.txt};
